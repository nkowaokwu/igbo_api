## Pull Request Process

### Before Opening a Pull Request

Double-check to make sure that you have done the following things:

1. If implementing a feature request, create new unit tests to increase confidence in your changes.
    * **You're code will be unable to get merged without new unit tests**
2. Check to see if your changes are non-breaking by running `yarn test`
3. And install or build dependencies are removed
    * You can run `yarn clean` to remove unwanted files.
4. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.

### After Opening a Pull Request
1. Open a pull request and assign at least one reviewer, [@ijemmao](https://github.com/ijemmao).
2. You may merge the pull request in once the following things happen
    * All the tests pass against your branch build
    * You have the sign-off from both reviewers
