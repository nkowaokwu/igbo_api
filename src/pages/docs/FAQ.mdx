## Is there a limit to how many requests I can make?

Yes. There's a daily limit of 2,500 requests. This number will reset to zero at the end of each day.

If you are making more than 2,500 requests per day, then we would reach out to see how we can increase your usage.

## What is Nsịbịdị?

[Nsịbịdị](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsibidi) is a proto-writing system that originates from the western region of Africa, which is modern day Nigeria.

We support Nsịbịdị because we believe that it's a viable alternative to writing Igbo and other West African languages when compared to Latin script.

## Why is there Chinese for Nsịbịdị? How can I use Nsịbịdị in my project?

You will need to download the Akagu font which will be able to transform the Chinese Unicode into Nsịbịdị characters.
