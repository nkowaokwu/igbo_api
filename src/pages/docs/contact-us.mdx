You can email the organization at [kedu@nkowaokwu.com](mailto:kedu@nkowaokwu.com). We would love to hear from 
you about anything you think could be improved on the website, future possible features, or bigger plans for the software.

If you would like to work with other amazing contributors, we have a Slack community that you can join by filling out [this form](https://nkowaokwu.com/volunteer).

If you're not interested in any of those options and just want to speak with Ijemma, you can send her a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ijemmaohno).
