# Getting Started

If you would like to start using the Igbo API in your production-ready projects, you can sign up for an [Igbo API developer token](https://igboapi.com/signup).

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your computer to run the project locally:

* Node.js
* Yarn
* MongoDB
* Firebase
* Redis (optional)
* Docker (optional)

## Installation

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and install its dependencies:

```bash
cd igbo_api/
yarn install
```

Build the frontend for the site:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Connect to a Firebase Project
This project uses Firebase and requires you create your own free Firebase project.

Please follow the [Firebase Configuration Guide](./guides/firebase).

## Local Development
Once you've configured your project, you can start the Igbo API dev server by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the API

## Optional: Development with Replica Sets and Redis
If you would like to run the API while running [MongoDB Replica Sets]() and a [Redis cache](), run:

```bash
yarn dev:full
```

Ensure that you have Redis installed on your machine. Then, run the following to start a Redis server:

```bash
redis-server
```

**Warning**: Running replica sets locally is a machine-intensive operation and should only be ran for testing or specific
feature development purposes.

## Alternative: Docker

If you don't want to run a local Node and MongoDB service, you can use Docker.

Run the following command:

```bash
yarn start:docker
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the API
