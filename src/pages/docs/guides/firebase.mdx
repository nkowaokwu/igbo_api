# Firebase Configuration Guide

This project relies on Firebase Cloud Functions to execute the Igbo API business logic.

Individual contributors need to integrate their own Firebase project config to be able to run the project locally and merge forked changes.

## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

Please follow this [Firebase Getting Started Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to create your own Firebase project.

## Step 2: Replace the `default` Firebase Project Name

Within [.firebaserc](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/.firebaserc), replace the project name `igbo-api-bb22d` with your new Firebase project name

## Step 3: Replace the Firebase Config file

Within [firebase.js](https://github.com/nkowaokwu/igbo_api/blob/master/src/services/firebase.js#L5-L13), replace the `FIREBASE_CONFIG` object with your firebase project config object

## Step 4: Merging forked changes into main repo

Congrats 🎉 You have a change you want to merge into the main repo. You will need to complete a few extra steps to ensure your branch builds pass.
