# Migrating Database

The database has gone through many data migrations since the beginning of this project. Whenever the data schema of the 
Word or Example model need to change, the contributor making that schema change will create a new migration script 
following the [`migrate-mongo` guides](https://www.npmjs.com/package/migrate-mongo).

Once you've created a migration script, you can run the following command to apply the migration to your local MongoDB database:

```bash
npm run migrate-up
```

If you want to rollback your migration, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run migrate-down
```
