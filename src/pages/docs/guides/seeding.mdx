# Seeding the Database

Follow these steps to populate the database:

## Build a Dictionary

We will need to build the dictionaries into a file that can be used to populate the MongoDB database.

The following command places the JSON dictionaries in the `dist/` directory:

```
npm run build:dictionaries
```

Here's an example JSON dictionary file: [ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json](./src/dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json)

## Populate the MongoDB Database

Now that the data has been compiled, it needs to be used to populate, or seed, the MongoDB database.

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Then make a `POST` request to the following route:

```
/api/v1/test/populate
```

For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/populate // POST
```

After about 20 seconds, you will see the `âœ… Seeding successful.` message in your terminal. Now you have data in your MongoDB database.
