# Testing

Creating and maintaining our automated tests ensure that the API is always reliable and stable for the community.

## Frontend

Frontend tests focus specifically on the Igbo API homepage using Cypress. First, run:

```
npm run build
```

Then run the following to start Cypress:

```
npm run cypress
```

## Backend

If you would like to have one terminal dedicated to running tests (the downside is a very noisy terminal), you can run 
the following:

```
npm run test
```

If you want to run your MongoDB instance and tests in separate terminals, you can run the following command in one terminal:

```
npm run start:database
```

Open another terminal and run the following:

```
npm run jest
```
